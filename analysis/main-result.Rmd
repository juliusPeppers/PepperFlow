## Project Cars
Analysis script for Project Car. Here we can explain exactly what this script is supposed to do. 


## Import the data
```{r  echo=FALSE}
library(car)
library(stats)
```


## Preliminary Data Analysis
Here we see are correlation between speed and distance. 
```{r}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```


## Fit Regression Model
Information about cars. Here we can explain what analysis we are doing in this section.
We are fitting a model to predict distance using speed etc.
```{r}
model  = lm(cars$dist~cars$speed)
```


## Model Diagnostics
Explain the results of the model here.
```{r}
summary(model)
```
